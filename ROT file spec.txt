ROT file specification

Abstract/Summary/intro:
A plaintext file that basically allows for one time pads (I think?) that use
Caesar shift (ROT) for encryption.

How it works:
Basically make a text file that has a series of elements that specifies how much
to ROTate by. An encryption program will read the ROT file, such that the first
character to be encrypted will be ROTated by the amount specified in the first
element of the ROT file, the second to be encrypted by the second element, etc.

These elements will either be comma separated integer values for easy reading
(in case you need to print them out, I guess), or a single string of base 26
numbers (which I just realised is simply the alphabet), for a smaller file size.

That's about it, I think. Consider using Base 36 for alphanumeric ROTation.
